const reactiveProgramming: string = `
This is a computing paradigm that says that information flow is propagated asynchronously. For example, if one service object queries another service for some data, the response does not happen at the same time. What this means is that the response might be accepted but gets evaluated at a later time. Once the response is ready, then there are several predefined ways (such as callbacks or Futures) to propagate it to consumers.

const reactiveSystems: string = `
A Reactive system is a set of concepts and design principles for building scalable and distributed applications that maintain an asynchronous way of communication. These stem from the Reactive manifesto, which is a document that defines the core principles of Reactive programming.

const functionalReactiveProgramming = `
This is a combination of Reactive programming with functional programming in terms of concepts and benefits. It is essentially the utilization of functional composition to manipulate streams of data or to ensure referential transparency. If you recall, we discussed referential transparency in our previous chapter, where we can replace a function with its value without changing the result of the program. Also known as FRP
