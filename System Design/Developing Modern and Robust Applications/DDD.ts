Domain Driver Design 

DDD represents an approach to software development that allows us to translate complex domain business logic into software components that match their meaning and purpose. It's a way that we can design applications that speak the same language as the problems they are solving.

The core focus of DDD circles around answering questions such as how do you organize business logic? or how can you manage complexity when the application grows over time? Those are valid questions, and the answers are not definite.
