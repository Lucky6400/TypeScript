/*
The Abstract Factory Pattern usually defines the interfaces of a collection of factory
methods, without specifying concrete products. This allows an entire factory to be
replaceable, in order to produce different products following the same production outline.

Different from the Factory Method Pattern, the Abstract Factory Pattern extracts another
part called client that take cares of shaping the outline of the building process. This makes
the factory part focused more on producing each component.
